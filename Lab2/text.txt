Time is money. It is a Treasure and yet we waste it foolishly. We waste it thoughtlessly in meaningless activities. If we take care of time, other things we will take care of themselves automatically.
We all grow in time, live in the time and die in time. But great men and women of the world make the use of time in their best possible way. They know how precious is time.
Every minute is valuable for them and so they take good care of it and so leave their footprints on the Sands of Time.It is destiny, it is history and civilization. Nothing is beyond time. People want success, happiness, fame, etc., but only a few have these because they know the value of time.
They make the best use of it. Time is an opportunity. If it slips ones for our hand, it can never be had again. Time is more precious than money. It is more powerful than kings and princes.
They come and go but time is forever. It is neither a beginning nor an end. We recognize it as birth, growth, decay, and death. It can be spent using fully or foolishly.
Every person should know the value of time and so make maximum use of it. One can follow the footsteps of a great man. We can see how did they use time, how did they spend their life.
And that will show us the path. What is important is the present. It is foolishness to postpone work for tomorrow. It is equally stupid to repent for the lost past. There is no tomorrow nor yesterday.
Our activities should be well planned so as to save time. There is no room for idleness and indecisions. Idlers are great Enemies of mankind. Delays and inaction are the thieves of time.
